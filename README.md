# Ursina Engine - Now with Particles 

## What is this?
This is a fork of the Ursina Engine, a game engine for Python. This fork adds particles, allowing you to use the brand new ursina particle manager I made.

## How do I use it?

### Installation

1. Clone this repository (in the particles branch)
2. Copy the `ursina` folder into your project folder
3. Import `ursina` in your project using `from ursina import *`
4. Run your project like you would a normal Ursina project

### Usage

There is a new folder in the samples one which contains an example of how to use the particle manager.

## Getting Started
1) Install [Python 3.10 or newer.](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100)

2) Open cmd/terminal and type:

```
pip install ursina
```


To get the newest, in development version from GitHub, install it like this:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/pokepetter/ursina.git
```


If you want to easily edit the source, it's recommended to clone the git
repo and pip install with --editable flag like this. Make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com) installed.

```
git clone https://github.com/pokepetter/ursina.git
cd ursina
pip install --editable .
```


Also install any of the optional dependencies you want from the list below,
or install them all with:

```
pip install ursina[extras]
```


On some systems you might have to use pip3 instead of pip in order to use Python 3 and not the old Python 2.
To use a specific Python version, use:
```
python3.xx -m pip install ursina
```
Where 3.xx is the version you want to target.


## Dependencies
  * python 3.10+
  * panda3d
  * pillow, for texture manipulation
  * psd-tools, for converting .psd files
  * blender, for converting .blend files
  * pyperclip, for copy/pasting


## Examples
``` python
from ursina import *            # this will import everything we need from ursina with just one line.

app = Ursina()
ground = Entity(
    model = 'cube',
    color = color.magenta,
    z = -.1,
    y = -3,
    origin = (0, .5),
    scale = (50, 1, 10),
    collider = 'box',
    )

app.run()                       # opens a window and starts the game.
```

## How do I make a game?
Ursina games are made by writing Python code. You can use any text editor you want, but personally I like to use Atom.
1) Create an empty .py file called `ursina_game.py`
2) Copy this text into your new file:
``` python
from ursina import *           # this will import everything we need from ursina with just one line.

app = Ursina()

player = Entity(
    model = 'cube' ,           # finds a 3d model by name
    color = color.orange,
    scale_y = 2
    )

def update():                  # update gets automatically called by the engine.
    player.x += held_keys['d'] * .1
    player.x -= held_keys['a'] * .1


app.run()                     # opens a window and starts the game.
```

3) Run this in the terminal start the game:

       python ursina_game.py
   
   ... or run it with your editor/IDE of choice.

4) You can now move the orange box around with 'a' and 'd'!

   To close the window, you can by default, press control+shift+alt+q or press the red x.
