## Troubleshooting

<b>ursina installed successfully, but python can't find it when I try to run a script</b>

If you have multiple Python installs, make sure you installed ursina to the correct one.
You can specify which Python version to install to like this:
```
python3.10 -m pip install ursina
```

If you're using a venv, make sure you're installing it to the venv and not to the default location.
