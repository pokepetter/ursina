### Collision

## Adding Colliders

# code
e = Entity(model='sphere', x=2)
e.collider = 'box'      # add BoxCollider based on entity's bounds.
e.collider = 'sphere'   # add SphereCollider based on entity's bounds.
e.collider = 'mesh'     # add MeshCollider based on entity's bounds.

e.collider = BoxCollider(e, center=Vec3(0,0,0), size=Vec3(1,1,1))   # add BoxCollider at custom positions and size.
e.collider = SphereCollider(e, center=Vec3(0,0,0), radius=.75)      # add SphereCollider at custom positions and size.
e.collider = MeshCollider(e, mesh=e.model, center=Vec3(0,0,0))      # add MeshCollider with custom shape and center.
# text

Usually you add the collider when you create the Entity, but make sure you set the model
before setting the collider if you want it to fit its bounds.

# code
e = Entity(model='cube', collider='box')
# text

## raycast()

# code
raycast(origin, direction=(0,0,1), distance=inf, traverse_target=scene, ignore=list(), debug=False)
# text

Casts a ray from *origin*, in *direction*, with length *distance* and returns
a HitInfo containing information about what it hit. This ray will only hit entities with a collider.

Use optional *traverse_target* to only be able to hit a specific entity and its children/descendants.
Use optional *ignore* list to ignore certain entities.
Setting debug to True will draw the line on screen.

Example where we only move if a wall is not hit:

# code
from ursina import *
app = Ursina()

class Player(Entity):

    def update(self):
        self.direction = Vec3(
            self.forward * (held_keys['w'] - held_keys['s'])
            + self.right * (held_keys['d'] - held_keys['a'])
            ).normalized()  # get the direction we're trying to walk in.

        origin = self.world_position + (self.up*.5) # the ray should start slightly up from the ground so we can walk up slopes or walk over small objects.
        hit_info = raycast(origin , self.direction, ignore=(self,), distance=.5, debug=False)
        if not hit_info.hit:
            self.position += self.direction * 5 * time.dt

Player(model='cube', origin_y=-.5, color=color.orange)
wall_left = Entity(model='cube', collider='box', scale_y=3, origin_y=-.5, color=color.azure, x=-4)
wall_right = duplicate(wall_left, x=4)
camera.y = 2

app.run()
# text


## boxcast()
# code
boxcast(origin, direction=(0,0,1), distance=9999, thickness=(1,1), traverse_target=scene, ignore=list(), debug=False)   # similar to raycast, but with width and height
# text

boxcast is similar to raycast, but the "ray" has thickness, height and width.


## intersects()

Check if a entity (with a collider) intersects other entities with colliders.

# code
from ursina import *


app = Ursina()

player = Entity(model='cube', color=color.orange, collider='box', origin_y=-.5)
trigger_box = Entity(model='wireframe_cube', color=color.gray, scale=2, collider='box', position=Vec3(1,0,2), origin_y=-.5)
EditorCamera()

def update():
    player.z += (held_keys['w'] - held_keys['s']) * time.dt * 6
    player.x += (held_keys['d'] - held_keys['a']) * time.dt * 6

    if player.intersects(trigger_box).hit:
        trigger_box.color = color.lime
        print('player is inside trigger box')
    else:
        trigger_box.color = color.gray

app.run()
# text




## HitInfo
All of these functions will return a HitInfo. This contains information about what it hit.

# code
hit = None
entity = None
point = None
world_point = None
distance = math.inf
normal = None
world_normal = None
hits = []
entities = []
# text

## Distance Check
Sometimes it enough to just check the distance between two entities.
For example if you want a pickup:

# code
from ursina import *
from ursina.prefabs.first_person_controller import FirstPersonController


app = Ursina()

ground = Entity(model='plane', texture='grass', scale=10, collider='box')
player = FirstPersonController(model='cube', origin_y=-.5, color=color.orange, has_pickup=False)
camera.z = -5

pickup = Entity(model='sphere', position=(1,.5,3))

def update():
    if not player.has_pickup and distance(player, pickup) < pickup.scale_x / 2:
        print('pickup')

        player.has_pickup = True
        pickup.animate_scale(0, duration=.1)
        destroy(pickup, delay=.1)

app.run()
# text


## Mouse Collision
The mouse does raycast automatically.
Both UI elements(Entities parented to camera.ui) and Entities in 3d space (parented to scene) can
get hit as long as they have a collider. UI elements will however block things behind them.

mouse.hovered_entity      returns
mouse.normal              # returns the normal of the polygon, in local space.
mouse.world_normal        # returns the normal of the polygon, in world space.
mouse.point               # returns the point hit, in local space
mouse.world_point         # returns the point hit, in world space

Handling clicks is very easy, just add a collider and on_click.
The on_click function will then be called when you click on the Entity with the mouse.

# code
def action():
    print('Ow! That hurt!')

Entity(model='quad', parent=camera.ui, scale=.1, collider='box', on_click=action) # on_click should be a function/callable/Func/Sequence
