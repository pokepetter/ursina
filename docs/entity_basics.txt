## What is an Entity?

    An entity is a thing in the world, and is the "god class" in ursina.
    It's like a GameObject in Unity or an Actor in Unreal.

    It can have a position, rotation, and scale.
    It can have a model, texture, and color.
    It can have an update function, input function, and scripts.
    For an overview of all its attributes and functions, see https://www.ursinaengine.org/cheat_sheet.html#Entity



## Setting a model

    There are several included models like 'quad', 'plane', 'cube', and 'sphere',
    but you can also use your own.
    To do that simply give the base name of your model and it will glob/search for
    the model and take the first one it finds.

    Supported file types are:
        * obj
        * bam (binary format)
        * blend (gets auto converted to an obj)
        * ursinamesh (custom human readable format identical to how you'd make a Mesh in code)

    # code
    Entity(model='name_of_your_model')
    # text



## Texture

    Setting a texture is similar to setting a model. Just give it a name in this case as well:

    # code
    e1 = Entity(model='cube', texture='texture_name')

    # other ways are:
    e2 = Entity(model='cube', texture=e1.texture) # or set it to another Texture
    e3 = Entity(model='cube', texture=PIL.Image.new(mode="RGBA", size=(854,480))) # set a PIL texture
    e4 = Entity(model='cube', texture='movie_name.mp4') # set video texture
    # text

    For 2d graphics there's also the Sprite class, which is simply an Entity with a
    'quad' model and scale set to automatically fit the size and aspect ratio of the texture.

    # code
    s = Sprite('texture_name')
    print(s.aspect_ratio)
    # text



## Setting the color

    # code
    e.color = color.red # set it to a color in the color module

    e.color = color.color(120, .5, .5) # hsv color
    e.color = color.rgb(.8, .1, 0) # rgb color
    e.color = e.color.tint(.1) # tint the color
    e.color = color.random_color() # set it to a random color
    e.color = lerp(color.red, color.green, .5) # set it to a color half way between red and green
    # text



## Moving

    You can move an entity by setting the attributes:
    'position', 'x', 'y', 'z', 'world_position', 'world_x', 'world_y', 'world_z'

     # code
     # you can give it a position when you create i, or you can omit it and set it later
     e = Entity(position=(0,0,0))
     # set position relative to parent entity:
     e.position = Vec3(0,0,0)
     e.position = Vec2(0,0)
     e.position = (0,0,0)
     e.position = (0,0)

     # shortcuts for individual axes:
     e.x = 0
     e.y = 0
     e.z = 0

    # set position relative to the world:
     e.world_position = (0,0,0)
    # text

    See https://www.ursinaengine.org/coordinate_system.html for more
    information on how the coordinate system works.



## Rotating

    #code
    e.rotation = (0,0,0)
    e.rotation_y = 90
    # text

    The look_at() method can also be for pointing an entity at something:

    #code
    other_entity = Entity(position=(10,1,8))

    e.look_at(other_entity) # make z-axis(forward) point at other_entity
    e.look_at(other_entity, axis='up') # optionally define which axis
    # text



## Scaling

    Change the size of the entity by setting the scale attribute:

    # code
    e = Entity(model='cube', scale=(3,1,1))
    # text



## Update

    An Entity's update method will be called automatically:

    # code
    e = Entity()
    def my_update():
        e.x += 1 * time.dt # dt is short for delta time, the duration since the last frame.

    e.update = my_update
    # text

    Or you can implement it by inheriting the Entity class:

    # code
    class Player(Entity):
        def update(self):
            self.x += 1 * time.dt
    # text



## Input

    The same goes for the input method:

    # code
    class Player(Entity):
        def input(self, key):
            if key == 'w':
                self.position += self.forward

            if key == 'd':
                self.animate('rotation_y', self.rotation_y + 90, duration=.1)

            if key == 'a':
                self.animate('rotation_y', self.rotation_y - 90, duration=.1)
    # text


## Mouse Input

    Entities can react to the mouse as long as they have collider.
    Buttons will have one by default, but you can also assign one.

    To get the entity currently under the mouse:
    #code
    print(mouse.hovered_entity)
    # text

    To check if and entity with a collider is hovered by the mouse:
    # code
    print(my_entity.hovered)
    # text

    There are also functions for handling mouse clicks and hover/unhover.
    These only works if the Entity has a collider and the function/callable is assigned.

    # code
    on_click()
    on_double_click()
    on_mouse_enter()
    on_mouse_exit()
    # text

    Example:
    # code
    def action():
        print('Ow! That hurt!')

    Entity(model='quad', parent=camera.ui, scale=.1, collider='box', on_click=action) # on_click should be a function/callable/Func/Sequence
    # text

    on_mouse_enter and on_mouse_exit example:
    # code
    b = Button(scale=(.5, .25), text='zzz')
    b.on_mouse_enter = Func(setattr, b, 'text', 'Hi, friend :D')
    b.on_mouse_exit = Func(setattr, b, 'text', '''No! Don't leave me ;-;''')
    # text


## Other Magic Functions

    Sometimes you want side effects when you enable/disable and entity, like play an animation or something.

    # code
    on_enable()
    on_disable()
    # text
