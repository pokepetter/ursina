## Powered by Python
# size 1

Python is the world's most popular programming language for a reason. The ease of use of Python combined with ursina's design, makes it easy to write concise code and avoid lots of boilerplate code.

# size 0.8
# code
from ursina import *

app = Ursina()

cube = Entity(model='cube', color=hsv(300,1,1), scale=2, collider='box')

def spin():
    cube.animate('rotation_y', cube.rotation_y+360, duration=2, curve=curve.in_out_expo)

cube.on_click = spin
EditorCamera()  # add camera controls for orbiting and moving the camera

app.run()

## Iterate Faster
# size 1

• Reload code/textures/models while in-game
• Automatic import of .psd and .blend files
• Compile times:

Iteration speed benchmark. Time from code/scene change to play. Game: pong clone. Lower is better.
