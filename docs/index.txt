## Powered by Python

Python is the world's most popular programming language for a reason. The ease of use of Python combined with ursina's design, makes it easy to write concise code and avoid lots of boilerplate code.

# size 0.8
```
from ursina import *

app = Ursina()

cube = Entity(model='cube', color=hsv(300,1,1), scale=2, collider='box')

def spin():
    cube.animate('rotation_y', cube.rotation_y+360, duration=2, curve=curve.in_out_expo)

cube.on_click = spin
EditorCamera()  # add camera controls for orbiting and moving the camera

app.run()

```

## Make Any Type of Game

2D games, 3D games, applications, visualizations, you can make anything you want with ursina.

## Iterate Faster

• Reload code/textures/models while in-game
• Automatic import of .psd and .blend files
• Compile times:

Iteration speed benchmark. Time from code/scene change to play. Game: pong clone. Lower is better.

```
engine:         duration:       times as slow:

ursina          00.01s          1x
Godot           01.18s          118x
Unity           11.45s          1145x
```


## Modern UI

• Sleek modern design.
• Full control. Change the looks of anything, down to the smallest details.
• Built with Entities like everything else, so you don't have to relearn anything.

## Batteries Included

• Easy to use mesh class for making procedural geometry
• Built-in animation and tweening
• Pre-made prefabs such as FirstPersonController, 2d platformer controller, editor camera
• Lots of included procedural 3D primitives
• Many shaders to choose from, or write your own with GLSL
