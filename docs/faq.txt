### Frequently Asked Questions


## How should I structure my project?

```
project_folder/         # create a new folder for each project
    enemies.py
    level.py
    main.py             # the starting script
    player.py
    player_sprite.png
    textures/           # assets can be placed alongside the scripts or in a folder below
        enemy_1.png
        enemy_2.png
```




## How do I move the camera?

The camera is an Entity, so you can move and rotate it just like everything else:
    ```
    camera.position = Vec3(1,1,0)
    ```



## Why should I use Python for game development. Isn't it slow?

Not really. The most performance critical part are written in C++ or shader code.
Python can make you more productive as a developer and thus make it easier
to structure your project in a good way, rather than micro-optimize.




## How do I call a function with a delay?</b>

```
invoke(some_function, arg1, kwarg1='some kwarg', delay=2)
```



## How can I use panda3d alongside ursina?

What you need to know is that Entity is a NodePath and Ursina is a ShowBase.
You can also write custom shaders, see panda3d's shader documentation for that.
